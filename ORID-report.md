### ORID Report - Emily
#### Objective: What Did We Learn Today?
Today, we learned about important concepts in SpringBoot, such as JPA, various annotations, and the idea of layering architecture. These topics are essential for building applications with SpringBoot.

#### Reflective: My Feelings
I found the experience quite challenging. The material was complex, which made it tough at times, but it also showed me how important it is to keep pushing through when learning something new.

#### Interpretive: Why?
The challenges I faced were mainly because I am new to SpringBoot. While this session was a great chance to learn about its features and JPA, I ran into many bugs during assignments and practice. This highlighted a big knowledge gap that I need to fill.

#### Direction: Action Points - What Changes Will I Make?
To improve, I plan to set aside more time to study SpringBoot and JPA, use online resources to learn more, and practice with small projects. I will also ask for help when I get stuck and consider joining study groups to work with others. By doing these things, I hope to get better at SpringBoot and feel more confident in tackling future challenges.
